Linear Search Algorithm
-> In linear search, we search an element in a given array or list by traversing the array or list from left to right, till the desired element is found.

-> The time complexity of the linear search is O(n).

# Implementation of the linear search.
 1. Traverse the array using a for loop.
 2. In every iteration, compare the target value with the current value of the array.
    a. If the values match, return the current index of the array.
    b. If the values do not match, move on to the next array element.
 3. If no match is found return -1.
